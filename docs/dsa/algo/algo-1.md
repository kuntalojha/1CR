#  **Analysing Algorithm (TC & SC).**

**Algorithms Definition:**
 - It is a combination of sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.
**Example:**
 > m = 75, n = 200 add m and n.
 
 **Algorithm:**
```
 AddTwoNumbers() 
 {
   1. Take 2-numbers m && n.
   2. Add m && n store in c.
   3. print the variable c.
 }
```

**Properties of Algorithm:**
 1. It should stop after finite time.
 2. It should produce at least one output.
 3. - It should be deterministic. (OR)
    - It should be unambiguous.
 4. It should effective.

 **Steps to design an algorithm:**
1. Problem definition. (know the problem clearly)
 - Example:
   ```md
    Input₁ ----- Output₁
    Input₂ ----- Output₂
    Input₃ ----- Output₃
    ----------
    ----------
    Inputₙ ----- Outputₙ
   ```
2. Design the algorithm.
  - Example:
    ```md
    Divide And Conquer (DAC)
    Greedy Technique (GT)
    Dynamic Programming (DP) 
    Branch and Bound (BnB)/(B.B)
    Backtracking (BT)
   ```
